    "## 0. Our example\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll use a concrete example to make the process clear, but of course the process explained here is the same for any dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example. You have a dataset on road traffic objects. Let this dataset contain annotations for the following object classes of interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "`['car', 'truck', 'pedestrian', 'bicyclist', 'traffic_light', 'motorcycle', 'bus', 'stop_sign']`\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, your dataset contains annotations for 8 object classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would now like to train an SSD300 on this dataset. However, instead of going through all the trouble of training a new model from scratch, you would instead like to use the fully trained original SSD300 model that was trained on MS COCO and fine-tune it on your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is: The SSD300 that was trained on MS COCO predicts 80 different classes, but your dataset has only 8 classes. The weight tensors of the classification layers of the MS COCO model don't have the right shape for your model that is supposed to learn only 8 classes. Bummer.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what options do we have?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Just ignore the fact that we need only 8 classes\n",
    "\n",
    "The maybe not so obvious but totally obvious option is: We could just ignore the fact that the trained MS COCO model predicts 80 different classes, but we only want to fine-tune it on 8 classes. We could simply map the 8 classes in our annotated dataset to any 8 indices out of the 80 that the MS COCO model predicts. The class IDs in our dataset could be indices 1-8, they could be the indices `[0, 3, 8, 1, 2, 10, 4, 6, 12]`, or any other 8 out of the 80. Whatever we would choose them to be. The point is that we would be training only 8 out of every 80 neurons that predict the class for a given box and the other 72 would simply not be trained. Nothing would happen to them, because the gradient for them would always be zero, because these indices don't appear in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would work, and it wouldn't even be a terrible option. Since only 8 out of the 80 classes would get trained, the model might get gradually worse at predicting the other 72 clases, but we don't care about them anyway, at least not right now. And if we ever realize that we now want to predict more than 8 different classes, our model would be expandable in that sense. Any new class we want to add could just get any one of the remaining free indices as its ID. We wouldn't need to change anything about the model, it would just be a matter of having the dataset annotated accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, in this example we don't want to take this route. We don't want to carry around the computational overhead of having overly complex classifier layers, 90 percent of which we don't use anyway, but still their whole output needs to be computed in every forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what else could we do instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Just ignore those weights that are causing problems\n",
    "\n",
    "We could build a new SSD300 with 8 classes and load into it the weights of the MS COCO SSD300 for all layers except the classification layers. Would that work? Yes, that would work. The only conflict is with the weights of the classification layers, and we can avoid this conflict by simply ignoring them. While this solution would be easy, it has a significant downside: If we're not loading trained weights for the classification layers of our new SSD300 model, then they will be initialized randomly. We'd still benefit from the trained weights for all the other layers, but the classifier layers would need to be trained from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not the end of the world, but we like pre-trained stuff, because it saves us a lot of training time. So what else could we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 3: Sub-sample the weights that are causing problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of throwing the problematic weights away like in option 2, we could also sub-sample them. If the weight tensors of the classification layers of the MS COCO model don't have the right shape for our new model, we'll just **make** them have the right shape. This way we can still benefit from the pre-trained weights in those classification layers. Seems much better than option 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The great thing in this example is: MS COCO happens to contain all of the eight classes that we care about. So when we sub-sample the weight tensors of the classification layers, we won't just do so randomly. Instead, we'll pick exactly those elements from the tensor that are responsible for the classification of the 8 classes that we care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, even if the classes in your dataset were entirely different from the classes in any of the fully trained models, it would still make a lot of sense to use the weights of the fully trained model. Any trained weights are always a better starting point for the training than random initialization, even if your model will be trained on entirely different object classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course, in case you happen to have the opposite problem, where your dataset has **more** classes than the trained model you would like to fine-tune, then you can simply do the same thing in the opposite direction: Instead of sub-sampling the classification layer weights, you would then **up-sample** them. Works just the same way as what we'll be doing below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get to it."
